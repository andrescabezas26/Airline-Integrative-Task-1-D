A group of students will develop a Java algorithm for an airline to improve the order of the boarding and disembarking process. The program will simulate a passenger database from a plain text file, allow the efficient retrieval of complete passenger information, and register their arrival at the gate. The system will display the order of passenger boarding and disembarking, taking into account the proximity to the aisle or arrival order. Additionally, the system will prioritize the first-class passengers based on their accumulated miles, special attention required, seniority, or other relevant data.

Implementation notes:

- Text editor used: Visual Studio Code.

- Data loading: We implemented a method called loadData() and readPassengersArrivalOrder() which read txt files containing information about passengers and their arrival order, respectively. The txt files are located in a folder called "data" within the project.

- The txt files can be modified to change the specifications of the plane, passenger information, and arrival order.

- Detailed information about the problem solution can be found in the project documentation.
