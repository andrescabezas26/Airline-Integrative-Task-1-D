A group of students will develop a Java algorithm for an airline to improve the order of the boarding and disembarking process. The program will simulate a passenger database from a plain text file, allow the efficient retrieval of complete passenger information, and register their arrival at the gate. The system will display the order of passenger boarding and disembarking, taking into account the proximity to the aisle or arrival order. Additionally, the system will prioritize the first-class passengers based on their accumulated miles, special attention required, seniority, or other relevant data.
